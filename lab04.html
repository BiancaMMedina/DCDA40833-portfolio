            <h2>1. Data Preparation</h2>
            <p>
             To prepare the dataset, I used Kaggle, a website I worked with last semester in my coding class. 
             I remembered that I had an interesting CSV file on “Top Beauty Brands of 2024” that I never got a chance to use. 
             Downloading the CSV was easy, I quickly found it in my downloads folder and imported it into Tableau. 
             Once downloaded I was able to see a table filled with all my favorite makeup brands that I still continuously use today. The download and upload process was a breeze and easier than expected.             </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Design Choices</h2>
            <p>
                <br> For the first visualization titled, “Top Beauty Brand and Cosmetic Ratings of 2024,” I used Brand as the main dimension in my column while also using the metric “Average Rating” in my rows. I also dragged ‘Brand’ into the color section under marks to differentiate the different brands. Lastly, I listed them from lowest average rating to highest to keep it organized and cohesive. <br> 
                
               <br>  For the second visualization titled, “Total Number of Reviews by Product Category and Gender,” I used Product Category and Gender Target as dimensions in the columns. The metric for this visualization is Total Number of Reviews in the rows section. Here I color coded the categories to allow for direct comparison and to highlighting which product categories receive the most attention and how engagement varies by gender target. <br> 
                
               <br>  For the final visualization titled, “Average Product Price by Skin Type and Cruelty Free Products” I used ‘skin type’, ‘cruelty-free’, and ‘main ingredient’ as dimensions in the columns. For the metric I used the average price (USD) in the row section. I wanted the dimension ‘cruelty free’ to be highlighted so I color coded it to reveal if it was in fact cruelty free (true) or not (false). <br> 

            </p>

            <h2>3. Expected Patterns</h2>
            <p>
               <br>  Based on the selected metrics and dimensions, I expected to see high-end/luxury beauty products to be more expensive, highly rated, and have cleaner ingredients. For the lower end/ cheaper products I expected lower ratings, lower prices, and contain ingredients that may damage the skin. I also hypothesized that men would favor products with a lighter skin feel compared to the heavier formulations typically preferred by women. Lastly, I expect to see every day-use products to generate higher engagement, since these products are widely used across routines and skill levels. <br>  
                
               <br>  Upon inspection of my visualizations, I made some interesting discoveries. The first discovery I made was with the first set of data titled, “Top Beauty Brand and Cosmetic Ratings of 2024”. <br> 
                
                Out of thousands and thousands of reviews I was shocked to see that there wasn’t much of a difference in average ratings between the highest rated and lowest rated brands. The lowest rated beauty brand (Patrick Ta) and the highest rated beauty brand (Milk Makeup) only differed 0.2422 in ratings. All of the brands clustered very tightly around the same average rating (roughly around 3.0) with not dramatic spikes or drops. <br> 

              <br>  In the second visual I noticed that setting spray, eyeliner, makeup remover, facemasks, and serums show some of the highest total review counts, particularly for female-targeted products. Above I mentioned that everyday use products would generate high engagement and based on the graph I was correct. <br> 
               
               <br>  The last visual was the most interesting in my opinion. It centered around the “Average Product Price by Skin Type and Cruelty Free Products”. This chart compares the average price (USD) of skincare products across skin type (combination, dry, and normal), cruelty-free status (true versus false), and main ingredient, including aloe vera, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, retinol, salicylic acid, shea butter, and vitamin C. <br>

            <h2>4. Surprises / Outliers</h2>
            <p>
                
              <br>   In the first visual I was shocked to see that there wasn’t more of a variety in ratings, and I learned through this graph that no single brand clearly dominated as the ‘best brand’. Even the most expensive brands tied neck and neck with brands that are much cheaper, completely disagreeing with my first hypothesis.  <br> 

               <br>  In the second visual I was surprised to see that that several categories with the highest number of reviews were reviewed by males. This makes sense when considering that male-focused products tend to be more practical and routine-based, which may encourage consistent use and higher review activity.<br> 

               <br>  With the last visual I was surprised to learn that prices don’t vary much by ingredient, even though ingredients like retinol and vitamin C are often marketed as more “premium,” and that cruelty-free products are only slightly more expensive, not dramatically so, across all skin types. I expected cruelty free products to be more expensive based off of my own experience shopping for beauty products; I was relieved to see that my hunch was right. <br>

            <h2>5. Questions for Further Investigation</h2>
            <p>
               <br> Do men tend to review products more often when they are practical or everyday items, compared to more appearance-focused products? <br> 
               <br>  Does the number of reviews reflect actual popularity, or just differences in who chooses to leave feedback online? <br> 
                
                <br> Why are products for dry skin generally more expensive than products for other skin types? <br>

            <h2>6. Tool Evaluation: Tableau Public</h2>
            <p>
I love Tableau because it turns data into engaging visualizations. While I could look through endless rows of data to find insights, seeing it visually makes it much easier for me to understand since I’m more of a visual learner. Being able to build graphs, maps, charts differentiate it from other platforms I’ve used in the past. 
There are other tools that can do things that Tableau cannot for example, Excel and Google Colab give me more control over the data itself and deeper analytical capabilities, while Tableau focuses on making visual storytelling interactive. Tableau Public does have limitations. Unfortunately, my project is public which means everyone can see what I’ve done, I don’t like the lack of privacy and would prefer not to pay for my privacy. 
I wish Tableau could have predictive modeling without the help of Python or Excel. </main>
