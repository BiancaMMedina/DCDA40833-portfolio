            <p>Welcome! This portfolio showcases my work in Digital Culture and Data Analytics, where I explore how data, design, and technology shape the digital world. Through projects that combine research, creativity, and technical skills, I focus on understanding digital spaces while building practical tools such as coding, data analysis, and web design. This site represents my growth as a student and highlights my interests in communication, digital culture, and emerging technologies.</p>
            <p>Each page represents a different lab assignment, building from foundational web development skills to data visualization and interactive mapping.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> My name is Bianca Medina, and I am a Strategic Communications major graduating in May 2026. One interesting fact about me is that I love music and already hold a degree in sound engineering and live production, which has shaped how I think about creativity, storytelling, and technical problem-solving.</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> What interests me most is how digital culture, creativity, and technology intersect to shape the way people communicate and build meaning online. I’m especially drawn to spaces like live music, beauty and makeup brands, and visual art, where storytelling, branding, and audience engagement play a major role. As someone who enjoys painting and drawing and has a background in sound engineering, I’m fascinated by how creative industries use data and digital tools to connect with communities and influence culture.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong>In this Digital Culture and Data Analytics (DCDA) course, I hope to improve my programming skills, learn how to create my own website, and gain practical skills that I can use both in school and in future careers. I’m interested in learning how data, design, and technology work together, and how they shape digital culture. Overall, I want to better understand online spaces while also expanding my creative and technical abilities. </p>
