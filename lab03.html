            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>Overall, the graphic showcases a lot of amazing statistics about the transportation of blood in Rwanda, while it is a great graphic there are some missing details that I would like to explore. The graphic focuses mainly on the outcomes and performance of the transportation of the blood. This makes it easy to understand at a glance, but it leaves out important context that would help viewers better understand the full scope of the program. The graphic includes several statistics, such as delivery time, speed, area coverage, and the percentage of Rwanda’s blood supply delivered by drones. These statistics show that drone delivery is faster and more efficient than previous methods, (for example a car or a truck). However, the information is presented without enough explanation of how these numbers were measured or what conditions influenced them. For example, the comparison between a 30-minute drone delivery and a four-hour pre-drone delivery does not explain what factors made earlier deliveries so slow, such as road conditions, distance, or even weather. Another interesting statistic in the infographic was the amount of blood supply delivered was 35%. I wonder why not more. Is there a specific amount of blood that needs to be transported due to the size of the drone? Does the size of the drone effect the amount of blood delivered? The infographic has great statistics but lacks specific information needed to do a full analysis of the situation. The source of this graphic comes from a daily British newspaper, the Guardian. In the Guardian it details much more information than the graphic and answers questions that wouldn’t be answered at first glance. </p>

            <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p>As for effects without causes the graphic shows outcomes like faster delivery, larger coverage, and the distribution of blood supply. This is great information, but it doesn't show why road transport was so slow, why drones were chosen over alternatives i.e. more clinics or better roads, and lastly what enabled this system. Without causes, the viewer is left with a narrative that: drones = innovation = success. The Guardian article makes it clear that the government and the centralized blood banking were crucial factors in the transportation of the supply of blood, none of which appear in the graphic. </p>

            <h3>Cherry Picking</h3>
            <p> As for cherry picking data, The graphic highlights maximum speed, payload, and ideal delivery time. However, it doesn’t mention cost per delivery, weather limitations, and failure due to grounded drones/flights. The data mostly just highlights the success of the program and doesn’t show how the results might differ, how the data is spread out, or what downsides might exist, so it doesn’t give the full picture.  </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion the graphic included many important statistics, I believe it had much more information than other graphics I’ve seen. It does a great job by grabbing the attention of the user and highlighting its successes. While it is helpful for general understanding, it lacks depth and must be more specific for viewers to understand what’s going on here. Sometimes it can be hard to see the big picture with just a small amount of space, but I believe some graphics could’ve been replaced with a paragraph detailing why and the limitations they experience delivering the blood. </p>
