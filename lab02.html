            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this lab, I will be exploring AI systems I have never used before to understand their capabilities, experiment with their functions, and learn how they handle different tasks. I will also examine the ethical considerations involved and reflect on how these tools can be used responsibly.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: Google Gemini</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>While using Google Gemini, I was pleasantly surprised by the accuracy of its responses. I intentionally asked misleading or incorrect questions to test its reliability, and the AI consistently corrected me or gently guided me toward the correct information. However, Gemini tends to avoid deeper interpretation, critique, or value-based judgments, which is where I believe it falls short. The answers that Google Gemini gives usually feel very neutral, safe, and somewhat generic.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Google Gemini excels at tasks involving long-form research and complex reasoning. It can process text, images, PDFs, and audio, handle large documents, and even serve as a personalized assistant for multi-step research or planning. However, it is less reliable for quick fact-checks or unfamiliar topics, as it may provide inaccurate information if it cannot access an online resource.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>When considering the ethical implications of these AI tools, it is important to remember that they generate content based on pre-existing online resources. From my experience, Google Gemini handles this responsibly. It provides real sources and includes links for verification, which is ethically positive because it credits the original authors and ensures the information can be traced. </p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Reve.AI</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p> I found using the image generator Reve.AI to be more interesting. I asked it to generate an image of a butterfly flying over a waterfall, it gave me four different versions to choose from. Some of the images looked more realistic, while others had a more cartoon-like style. I then wanted to test how well it could create a cartoon image, so I asked it to generate an Egyptian marketplace in the style of my favorite animation studio, Studio Ghibli. While the idea was creative, the results were not perfect. Some of the people were missing facial features, and certain animals were placed incorrectly, which showed the limitations of the image generator. Reve.Ai excels at producing images almost instantaneously but sometimes the images aren’t as realistic and can be missing some important details.   </p>
            
            
            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p> As for Reve.AI it excels at producing images almost instantaneously but sometimes the images aren’t as realistic and can be missing some important details. </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p> While the images it produces are impressive, it often mimics the work of well-known artists. For example, when I asked Reve AI to generate an image in the style of Studio Ghibli, originally created by the renowned animator and filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, it replicated his distinct animation style in under 10 seconds. This is notable because films like Spirited Away and Howl’s Moving Castle took years to produce and prepare. Miyazaki publicly condemns the use of generative AI saying that it’s “an insult to life itself”. Using these AI tools to generate images can be a big time and cost saver, but it raises significant ethical concerns.</p>

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p> Using AI for personal and academic purposes can be a slippery slope. When I started my academic journey, I was strongly advised never to use AI for any projects and only for personal purposes. Now, in my final semester, I am taking a class focused on AI and am encouraged to explore and use it. This shift shows how times have changed, and people are beginning to recognize that AI is a tool we need to learn to use if we want to advance our understanding of technology. I now use it both personally and in situations where professors ask me to incorporate it.
AI tools have a significant impact on DCDA, particularly in writing code. In the past, coding could take days, weeks, or even years to refine, whereas now AI can generate functional code in seconds. This changes how coding is approached in DCDA, offering both advantages and challenges. Despite AI’s capabilities, the human role in DCDA remains essential. AI cannot create independently; it requires imagination and a prompt from a human. We are the ones who provide the direction and ideas necessary for AI to produce meaningful work.
When evaluating a new AI tool in the future, I would ask questions such as: What is the tool’s primary purpose and which tasks does it perform best? How accurate and reliable are its results? Does it respect copyright and intellectual property? These are critical considerations to ensure the AI is used responsibly and effectively.
