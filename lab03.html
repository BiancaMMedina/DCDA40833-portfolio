            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>Overall, the visualization provides a clear and engaging overview of how drones are used for medical deliveries in Rwanda, but it's not clear in the information it presents. The graphic focuses mainly on performance statistics, which makes it easy to understand at a glance, but it leaves out important context that would help viewers better understand the full picture of the program. The visualization includes several data points, such as delivery time, speed, area coverage, and the percentage of Rwanda’s blood supply delivered by drones. These statistics show that drone delivery is faster and more efficient than previous methods. However, the information is presented without enough explanation of how these numbers were measured or what conditions influenced them. For example, the comparison between a 30-minute drone delivery and a four-hour pre-drone delivery does not explain what factors made earlier deliveries so slow, such as road conditions, distance, or weather.</p>

            <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p>The visualization shows outcomes like faster delivery, larger coverage, and the distribution of blood supply. This is great information but it doesn't show why road transport was so slow, why drones were chosen over alternatives i.e. more clinics or better roads, and lastly what policies, investments, or partnerships enabled this system. Without causes, the viewer is left with a narrative that: drones = innovation = success. The Guardian article makes it clear that government coordination, regulation, and centralized blood banking were crucial factors, none of which appear in the graphic.</p>

            <h3>Cherry Picking</h3>
            <p> The visualization highlights best-case performance for maximum speed, payload, and ideal delivery time. However, it fails to mention cost per delivery, weather limitations, and failure due to grounded drones/flights. The data mostly just highlights the success of the program and doesn’t show how the results might differ, how the data is spread out, or what downsides might exist, so it doesn’t give the full picture. </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion the infographic included many important metrics, I believe it had much more information than other graphics I’ve seen. It does a great job by grabbing the attention of the user and highlighting its success. While it is helpful for general understanding, it lacks depth and must be more specific for viewers to understand what’s going on here. Sometimes it can be hard to see the big picture with just a small amount of space, but I believe some graphics couldn’t been unused and replaced with a paragraph detailing why and how they deliver their blood. </p>
