        <section>
            <h2>1. Data Preparation</h2>
            <p>
                Discuss any errors you received trying to upload your dataset and what you needed to do to prepare it for a successful upload.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Design Choices</h2>
            <p>
                Describe the choices you made in terms of the visualization's metrics and dimensions.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Expected Patterns</h2>
            <p>
                Considering your metrics and dimensions, describe the patterns or trends you expected to see based on your understanding of the topic. 
                How much of your understanding is confirmed by the visualization? Focus on a particular section of the graph.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Surprises / Outliers</h2>
            <p>
                Describe where the visualization deviates from your expectations. Focus on sections with "outliers" or surprises you didn't expect.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Questions for Further Investigation</h2>
            <p>
                Draft questions that could help explain the outliers or surprises.
                The goal is to frame ideas for deeper analysis rather than provide
                definitive answers.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Tool Evaluation: Tableau Public</h2>
            <p>
                Evaluate Tableau Public as a visualization tool. What can it do that other tools cannot? What can other tools accomplish that Tableau Public cannot (at least as easily)? What limitations did you encounter?
