            <h2>Technical Understanding</h2>

            <h3> What features did I implement with AI assistance?? </h3>
            <p>
                I thought of four features and asked Claude Sonnet 4.5 to code them for my portfolio. Below are the four features I implemented with Ai assistance: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hamburger Toggle:</strong> Allows mobile users to toggle through different navigation tabs.</li>
                <li><strong>Scroll Reveal Animation:</strong> Animates elements to appear/disappear smoothly as users scroll.</li>
                <li><strong>Light and Dark Mode Toggle:</strong> Lets users switch between light and dark modes.</li>
                <li><strong>Progress Bar:</strong> Shows how far the user has scrolled on the page.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3> How does it work?</h3>
            <p>
                I understand the basic mechanics of the code: I tell the AI what I want, and it writes the code. 
                I’m confident with simple functions and if/else logic, but some coding language like threshold, root margin, and class list are still tricky for me to understand.
            </p>

            <h3> What did you modify? Did you need to fix bugs, adjust styling, or change functionality? </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Hamburger Toggle:</strong> I first began with the Hamburger Toggle. This worked perfectly; no changes needed after the prompt was given.<br>
                <strong>Scroll Reveal Animation:</strong> My second feature was my Scroll Reveal feature. Worked as intended and didn't need to add onto the prompt to get my desired outcome. <br>
                <strong>Light and Dark Mode:</strong> Initially too big and unflattering. I modified it to be smaller, removed the sun/moon symbols that it added in the beginning, and added it to all my tabs.<br>
                <strong>Progress Bar:</strong> Took several attempts to make the prompts work; I asked Claude Sonnet 4.5 to change the prompt about 5 times before it gave me a progress bar that worked. Once adjusted, it began to function correctly.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Process Evaluation -->
        <section class="reveal">
            <h2>Process Evaluation</h2>

            <h3> When was AI helpful?</h3>
            <p>
             AI accelerated the implementation of my different features, I don't know what I would've done without it. My portfolio would look very different if I had to write all the code myself. Ai provided me with a starting point and from there I was able to tweak the code to fit my needs. 
            </p>

            <h3> When was AI problematic?</h3>
            <p>
                For harder features (dark mode toggle, progress bar), AI initially game me code that didn't work or was not fully functional. I had to tweak prompts and make adjustments to get my desired outcome.
            </p>

            <h3> What's your role? In an AI-assisted workflow, what remains uniquely human? What can't (or shouldn't) be automated?</h3>
            <p>
                My role remains uniquely human: writing prompts, guiding AI, making design decisions, and interpreting how features should behave for users.
                I believe the human experience and how humans interact with something can never be understood by Ai. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Ethical Considerations -->
        <section class="reveal">
            <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

            <h3> Learning trade-offs: Does vibe coding help or hinder your development as a programmer?</h3>
            <p>
                Vibe coding helps me work efficiently with AI, but if I wanted to focus on "fundamentals first", it might hinder my learning and understanding of code.
            </p>

            <h3> Attribution: When using AI-generated code, what does proper citation look like? </h3>
            <p>
                Proper citation should look the same in academic and professional contexts, I believe in giving the person credit even when it’s extracted by an Ai tool. 
                I think you should always note which parts of the code were Ai assisted and include the tool you used. 
            </p>

            <h3>  Personal guidelines for AI use</h3>
            <p>
                I will use AI for debugging, understanding complex code, and generating ideas. I won’t use it for security-sensitive tasks, bypassing rules, or plagiarism.

        <!-- Prompts Used -->
        <section class="reveal">
            <h2>Prompts Used for Each Feature</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hamburger Toggle:</strong> Add a hamburger menu to my HTML portfolio. The nav should collapse into a hamburger icon on screens under 768px. Use vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks.</li>
                <li><strong>Light and Dark Mode:</strong>I am building a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I want to add a fully functional dark mode toggle. Please implement a clean, modern toggle button in the top-right corner of the navbar labeled “Dark Mode.” The dark mode should be controlled by applying a CSS class such as .dark-mode to the body element, and you should define both light and dark themes using CSS custom properties in root, so the color system is organized and scalable. Make sure the background, text, navbar, buttons, cards or project sections, and links (including hover states) all adjust appropriately when dark mode is enabled. Include smooth transitions between themes for a polished feel. </li>
                <li><strong>Scroll Reveal Animation:</strong> I want to add smooth, professional scroll-based reveal animations to my portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When elements enter the viewport while scrolling, they should fade in and slightly move upward (subtle translateY effect). The animation should feel clean and modern, not dramatic or distracting. Include smooth easing and clean timing (around 0.6–1s duration). Make sure the animation only triggers once per element (no repeating on scroll up/down unless easily configurable). The code should be production-ready, minimal, and well-commented.</li>
                <li><strong>Progress Bar:</strong> I want to add a thin scroll progress bar to the top of my portfolio website that visually indicates how far the user has scrolled down the page. The progress bar should be fixed to the top of the viewport, span the full width of the screen, and gradually fill from left to right as the user scrolls. The design should be minimal and modern. The bar should be thin (around 3–5px), smooth, and animated with a subtle transition effect. It should not interfere with my existing layout or navigation. Use vanilla JavaScript (no libraries). The progress width should dynamically calculate based on the total scrollable height of the page and update smoothly on scroll. Make sure it works across different screen sizes and handles responsive layouts correctly.</li>

            </ul>
        </section>
        <!-- Vibe Coding Guidelines Section -->
<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Vibe Coding Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        These are my personal rules for using AI in coding:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use AI for debugging code: I will use Ai to help me identify and fix errors in my code.</li>
        <li>Use AI to help understand complex code: I will use Ai to help me understand code that may be too difficult for me to read or analyze.</li>
        <li>Use AI to generate ideas or suggestions: I will use Ai to help me come up with new ideas or suggestions for my projects. </li>
        <li>Avoid using AI for anything security-related: I will not use Ai for tasks that could compromise security or privacy.</li>
        <li>Do not use AI to bypass rules or restrictions: I will not use Ai to bypass any paywalls, passwords, or security protections.  </li>
        <li>Do not use AI to plagiarize code or content: I will not use Ai to copy someone else's code or content without proper attribution or their permission. </li>
    </ul>

 <!-- Key Code Snippet Section -->
<section class="reveal">
    <h2> Key Code Snippet</h2>
    <p>
        Key code snippet using the understanding spectrum
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Fundamentals First: I did not write all the code from scratch, that is a skill I believe is set for those who are confident in coding by themselves and those who have worked with coding programs for years.  </li>
        <li> Collaborative: I don't believe I understood the pattern in the coding, while I did understand some words in the coding I don't think I'm at this stage just yet. I relied heavily on the code to help me understand unfamiliar syntax and patterns. One day with alot of practice I believe I could possibly be at this stage of coding.                  </li>
        <li>Vibe Coding: Throughout this assignment I believe I felt more comfortable with vibe coding, I was able to ask Claude to generate code to create certain features I wanted and I was able to read and understand what
            it produced. I was able to modify the code when it didn't work and work side by side with the Ai to get my desired outcome. 
        </li>
        <li>Full Automation: I don't believe I let the Ai do all the work for me, I can still be involved in the process of coding and make decisions about what I want to do. I think my input contributed to my results and without it full automation can lead to results that have no thought or creativity behind it.                    </li>
        
    </ul>

       // Dark Mode Toggle 
       // I understand how this code works, it just allows user to toggle back and forth between a dark mode and a light mode
       // This was very easy to implement and I think it adds a nice touch to my portfolio.
       // I will say that it did only work on one tab, I did have to adjust the code a little bit to make it work on all pages, its definitely working now
       // Had some issues with it covering my homepage and I wanted to remove the sun and moon symbols it embedded for me
       // I also had to make the toggle smaller it was too big



    z   // Get hamburger button and navigation menu Comments 
        // This code is responsible for toggling the navigation menu on mobile devices
        // I understand the logic of how the hamburger menu works and how it enhances the user experiences     
        // The hamburger menu was easy to implement and I didn't have any issues with it.


        // Scroll Reveal Animations Comments 
        // I wanted to add this feature to make my portfolio more dynamic and engaging.
        // I thought this was going to be hard to prompt but it was actually pretty easy to implement.
        // I believe this feature looks very cool and seperates it from other portfolios 

        //  A Scroll Progress Bar Comments 
        // I wanted to add this feature to give users a visual indicator of how far they are down the page 
        // I prompted the chat to implemet this feature but it did not give me a scroll bar
        // I was a little frustrated at first but I was able to get it working, I simply asked it to show me the scroll bar
        // After some convincing it finally gave me the code to implement the scroll bar, I think it looks pretty rad
